\begin{abstract}
The immense complexity of semiconductor production
% , characterized by high-volume, low-mix and low-volume, high-mix environments,
demands for advanced dispatching strategies that transcend traditional rule-based systems. This paper introduces a novel approach to dispatching rules derived from Swarm Intelligence (SI) techniques, specifically designed to tackle the intricate dynamics of large-scale semiconductor manufacturing processes. Our approach integrates simulation and optimization methods to investigate and enhance operational efficiency, addressing both the scalability of schedules and their practical implementation. We employ a customizable simulation framework to model a semiconductor manufacturing environment, wherein various dispatching rules % , including FIFO, CR, RANDOM,
as well as our proposed SI-driven method are assessed.
% The core of our approach lies in its ability to adaptively configure scheduling priorities based on real-time production dynamics, thus significantly improving the responsiveness and throughput of manufacturing processes.
The effectiveness of these dispatching rules is quantitatively evaluated through a series of simulations that measure key performance indicators such as Work in Progress (WIP) levels, throughput, and operational variability across different production scenarios.
This study not only elucidates the potential of SI techniques in refining production dispatching strategies, but also provides a simulation-based evaluation framework that can assist in the further development of intelligent dispatching systems.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Modern semiconductor fabs are highly complex and dynamic production
environments, whose efficient operation by means of automated scheduling
and control systems constitutes a pressing research challenge.
In this work, we model the production processes of large-scale
semiconductor fabs in terms of the well-known FJSSP.
In contrast to classical FJSSP benchmarks,
this leads to large-scale scheduling problems,
even if short planning horizons cover only a fraction of the long
production routes with hundreds of operations.
The resulting size and complexity of large-scale SMSP instances
exceed the capabilities of common FJSSP solving methods.
In our previous work \cite{Ali2024}, we showed the scalability of our proposed approach. 
We thus proposed the enhance variant of our previous GSACO algorithm, GSACO-O for optimizing operational troughput over different planning horizons.

We evaluated our scheduler through simulation as a dispatcher and compared the performance with traditional dispatching rules. In future work, we aim to evaluate our enhanced dispatching rule under different machine breakdown scenarios. 
Our second target of future work concerns hyperparameter tuning of GSACO-O parameetrs using machine learning.

We evaluated our scheduler by simulating it as a dispatcher and comparing its performance with traditional dispatching rules. The results indicate that our approach can potentially streamline operations. For future work, we plan to assess the effectiveness of our enhanced dispatching rule under various machine breakdown scenarios, which will provide insights into its resilience and adaptability in dynamic environments.
Additionally, we aim to explore hyperparameter tuning of GSACO-O parameters through machine learning techniques to further optimize performance. Leveraging machine learning could help us identify optimal configurations more efficiently, enhancing the scheduler's responsiveness and adaptability to different manufacturing setups.
